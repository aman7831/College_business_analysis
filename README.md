This project is a comprehensive financial modeling tool for launching a college affiliated with a foreign university in Nepal. It forecasts revenue, expenses, net profit, ROI, and cash flow over five years based on realistic student intake, fee structures, and operating costs. It includes breakeven analysis, loan amortization, and inflation-adjusted projections, and generates detailed Excel reports with charts. The model assumes each student pays NPR 200,000 for four semesters over two years and supports strategic planning by visualizing profitability, sustainability, and investment needs.
